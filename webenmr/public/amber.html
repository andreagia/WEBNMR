    <dt>Introduction to Amber web portal</dt>
    <dd>
        Amber (acronym to Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement) is a suite of programs
        <img width="256" height="128" src="/global/images/pro_small.png" class="right" title="1N3L" alt="1N3L"> that allow users
        to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on biological
        systems. <br>This web portal makes available the entire functionality of AMBER, in particular (but not only)
        using NMR-derived information as restraints for MD.
        <br>
        <br>
        To use AMBER eNMR GRID-enabled Molecular Dynamic you have to register to enmr <a href="http://www.enmr.eu/eNMR-registration">grid infrastructure</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        You can access a trial version of the service using username <i>guest</i> and password <i>guest</i>

        <br>
        <b>NB</b>: the trial version will not allow you to submit jobs on the e-NMR grid.
