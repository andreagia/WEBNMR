    <dd><b>Maximum Occurrence</b> (MaxOcc) refers to a method for making rigorous numerical assessments 
    about the maximum percent of time that a conformer of a flexible macromolecule can exist and
    still be compatible with the experimental data. Maximum Occurrence of a conformer is defined
    as the maximum weight that it can have in one ensemble that matches the average experimental data.
    To evaluate the Maximum Occurrence, an ensemble is sought so that the conformation under investigation
    is contained up to a certain value. At the Maximum Occurrence, no solution will be found fulfilling
    both the requisites of containing the desired conformation and of being compatible with the experimental
    data. Such process is exemplified in figure: the four boxes represent 4 different ensembles, containing
    the desired conformation (represented as a red star) at different weight (represented by the dimension of
    the red star): the fourth one is no more compatible with the experimental data.
