#Parameters for MO calculations
numstruct=Structures for which MO will be evaluated. You can input range values, i.e. 3-10,207-208,340-900 etc. 
weightconf=Fractional weights at which TF will be calculated. By default 0.0001 is calculated. Please don't use 1, as it will cause numerical errors.
dist1=If you already have the 0.0001 weight but still want to perform the automated analysis, please fill in Expected TF at zero weight field that will be used to compute the thresholds during the analysis. This field is optional but don't input 0.
dist2=If you already have the 0.0001 weight but still want to perform the automated analysis, please fill in Standard Deviation field that will be used to compute the thresholds during the analysis. This field is optional but don't input 0.
thresholds=Maximum allowed percent increase of the TF with respect to the lowest TF value, used as a cutoff for defining MO. Authomatically, 5 values are computed according to the mean and standard deviation of the TF values calculated for weight &#61 0 : 1SD, 3SD, 10SD, mean+10&#37;, mean+20&#37;
#Parameters for Minimization
maxnumstruct=Maximum number of structures that will be used to define the completing ensemble. It may range from 10 (faster) to 200 (more accurate). The value may be fine tuned to balance the gain in terms of tf with the lengthening of the calculation.
numstructstep=Initially an ensemble is build out of a limited number of structures. At each step the program adds the indicated value so as to match the maximum number of structures
numstepaddstruct=Number of steps in which the number of structures is raised
initnumens=When the ensembles are small, a larger number of them can be calculated so as to ensure larger variability. Should not be larger than 480.
ensremstep=At every addition of structures, some ensembles are removed to keep computational time at a bay
starttemp=High temperature for Simulated Annealing
targetmutrate=Maximum fraction of structure that are substituted by SA
weightmin= Sorry! For the moment only minimization with conjugate gradients is supported.
maxnumcg=
cggradtol=
satol=Minimum expected decrease in target function for every temperature. If It is not reached, then an informed version of Simulated Annealing is performed.
target=Minimum expected TF: if reached, the program exits
maxnumiter=Maximum number of random moves for each temperature step. The total number of moves throughout the whole calculation is given by this number times the number of temperature decrease in SA times the number of steps in which the number of structures are raised.
numtempstep=Number of steps in SA at which the temperature is decreased
weightSA=Throughout the calculation, the structures in the completing ensemble are changed at a rate that depends on the weight that they have after cg minimization. These number are chosen so that the higher minimization efficiency is ensured at the different minimization stages for Target Functions ranging between 0.2 and 1. 
weightinitreplace=Throughout the calculation, the structures in the completing ensemble are changed at a rate that depends on the weight that they have after cg minimization. These number are chosen so that the higher minimization efficiency is ensured at the different minimization stages for Target Functions ranging between 0.2 and 1. 
weightaddstruct=Throughout the calculation, the structures in the completing ensemble are changed at a rate that depends on the weight that they have after cg minimization. These number are chosen so that the higher minimization efficiency is ensured at the different minimization stages for Target Functions ranging between 0.2 and 1. 
weightheusteepdesc=Throughout the calculation, the structures in the completing ensemble are changed at a rate that depends on the weight that they have after cg minimization. These number are chosen so that the higher minimization efficiency is ensured at the different minimization stages for Target Functions ranging between 0.2 and 1. 
iterrestart= 
relweightpcs=The weight of the different restraints is to be adjusted so that their final contribution to the Target Function is balanced with respect to their quality
relweightrdc=The weight of the different restraints is to be adjusted so that their final contribution to the Target Function is balanced with respect
 to their quality
relweightsax=The weight of the different restraints is to be adjusted so that their final contribution to the Target Function is balanced with respect
 to their quality
multiharmonic=The multiplier for the harmonic restraint on weights is chosen so that the maximum allowed discrepancy is of the order of a few points per thousand. It can be increased but it slows down the calculation.
#Experimental data upload

exp-sax=s-value / measured intensity / error
exp-distance=Distances files contains the nearest neighbors for each structure (up to 10)
exp-struct=Structures files contains the chosen descriptors for each structure (up to 9)
exp-filename=Filenames file contains the name of files containing the calculated data for each structure
#RANCH and CALCALL data upload

ranchrefstruct=This domain is held in the position given in the pdb file
