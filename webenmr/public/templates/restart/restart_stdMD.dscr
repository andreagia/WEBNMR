This protocol can be used to restart a simulation carried out by presetted stdMD protocol, 
and it simply continue to run the simulation for 500ps as the last step of stdMD protocol. 

In the stdMD protocol, we equilibrated the solvated complex by carrying out a short minimisation,
50ps of heating and 50 ps of density equilibration with weak restraints on the
complex followed by 500ps of constant pressure equilibration at 300K.
At this stage, you basically used the same protocol as in the final stage of equilibration
and simply continued to run the simulation for 500ps. 
All simulations ran with SHAKE on hydrogen atoms, a 2 fs time step
and Langevin Dynamics for temperature control.
